	  <h1>2nd Annual Ruby BBQ &amp; Awards</h1>

    <br><p>It was a gem of a night! The evening summer air was warm and welcoming for the 80+ that attended the annual BBQ. Great stories and successes were celebrated within Van Ruby's community. Food and drink were aplenty. Everything went off without a hitch! Well, except for <a href="https://twitter.com/floriidaaa/status/505251938016198656/photo/1">this.</a></p>

    <br><p>As you all know, Vancouver is full of talented Ruby developers who contribute to open-source, develop gems and share good vibes at VanRuby events. And great work and commitment deserves recognition. So this year, the <a href="https://twitter.com/BrewhouseTeam">Brewhouse Team</a> threw together a site dedicated to honouring fellow Vancouver Rubyists. Members had the opportunity to vote or nominate a hero that they thought made the community awesome. At the end of the evening, a few of VanRuby's finest were revered by their peers.</p>

    <br><p>Congratulations to <a href="http://twitter.com/tammam">Tam</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/jncoops">Jenn</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/chancancode">Godfrey</a> for collecting the most votes! Here are a few of the lovely comments youreceived:</p>
